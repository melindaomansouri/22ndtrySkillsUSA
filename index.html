            <p>At <strong>Pier 68</strong> all of our boats are equipped with a fuel efficient Yamaha four stroke outboard motor. Each boat also has a ladder for getting in and out of the water. For navigation every Pier 68 rental boat is equipped with a color gps/chartplotter. Our deck boats and pontoon boats feature a bimini top for maximum shade and our fishing boats have a t-top for 360' fishibility. Most fishing boats are also equipped with a live bait well. Rod/reel rentals, as well as frozen bait, are available. <em>Here you will find the <strong>best prices</strong> for fishing boats, pontoon boats, and kayak rentals in the Keys!</em> </p>
